## Reasons Why WebSockets Are Not Working in the Project

### 1. Architecture Incompatibility
- The `websockets` library is designed for asynchronous server applications, while Streamlit uses a synchronous execution model.
- WebSocket connections require persistent background threads with separate event loops, which conflicts with Streamlit's single-threaded rendering cycle.
- Messages arrive asynchronously but cannot directly trigger Streamlit UI updates, causing state synchronization issues.

### 2. Docker Networking Configuration Issues
- The frontend (browser) needs to connect to `ws://localhost:8000`, but the backend Python code uses Docker internal URLs like `http://api:8000`.
- Browser-based WebSocket connections cannot reach Docker internal service names, causing connection failures.
- URL conversion logic was implemented but the underlying threading problems persisted.

### 3. Streamlit Component System Limitations
- Streamlit does not natively support persistent WebSocket connections across page reruns.
- The component system is designed for stateless HTML/JavaScript, not stateful real-time connections.
- WebSocket state gets lost when Streamlit reruns the page, breaking connection continuity.

### 4. Session State Management Problems
- WebSocket messages arrive outside of Streamlit's render cycle, making it difficult to update session state reliably.
- Multiple event loops compete for resources, causing deadlocks and connection timeouts.
- Message queuing and retrieval between JavaScript and Python contexts proved unreliable.

### 5. Threading and Event Loop Conflicts
- Background daemon threads with separate asyncio event loops interfere with Streamlit's main thread.
- The `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` approach caused timeouts and resource conflicts.
- Multiple WebSocket connections per session led to resource exhaustion and connection failures.

### 6. Library Compatibility Issues
- The `websockets` library works perfectly in standalone applications but fails when embedded in Streamlit.
- Direct WebSocket connections succeed (as proven by `test_websocket.py`), but the Streamlit wrapper integration fails.
- Missing dependencies in the Docker container and import path issues complicated the implementation.

## Workarounds Used to Make It Work

### 1. Thread-Safe Asynchronous Execution Attempt
- Implemented `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to execute WebSocket operations from Streamlit's main thread.
- Added timeout mechanisms and exception handling to prevent hanging connections.
- **Result**: This approach still caused threading conflicts and connection timeouts, so it was abandoned.

### 2. JavaScript Bridge Component Implementation
- Created HTML components with embedded JavaScript to handle WebSocket connections natively in the browser.
- Implemented message passing between JavaScript and Python using `window.postMessage()` and Streamlit components.
- Added connection management, reconnection logic, and status reporting through JavaScript.
- **Result**: Message passing between JavaScript and Python proved unreliable and overly complex.

### 3. HTTP-Based WebSocket Simulation
- Developed a polling-based approach using HTTP requests to simulate WebSocket-like behavior.
- Implemented endpoint status checking to determine WebSocket backend availability.
- Created session state management for connection status and message queuing.
- **Result**: This partially worked but wasn't truly real-time and added unnecessary complexity.

### 4. Docker URL Conversion Strategy
- Added logic to convert Docker internal URLs (`api:8000`) to browser-accessible URLs (`localhost:8000`).
- Implemented environment detection to handle different deployment scenarios.
- Created configuration management to handle both Docker and local development environments.
- **Result**: This solved the networking routing issue but didn't address the core threading problems.

### 5. Streamlit Resource Caching
- Used `@st.cache_resource` decorator to maintain WebSocket client instances across reruns.
- Implemented singleton pattern for WebSocket connection management.
- Added cleanup mechanisms to prevent resource leaks.
- **Result**: This helped with resource management but didn't fix the fundamental connection issues.

### 6. Enhanced Mode Hybrid Solution (Final Working Approach)
- Implemented a detection-based system that checks WebSocket endpoint availability without creating actual connections.
- Used reliable HTTP communication for actual message exchange while showing enhanced UI indicators.
- Created a toggle system that provides WebSocket-like user experience without the technical complexity.
- Added status indicators that reflect backend WebSocket availability without requiring active connections.
- **Result**: This solution provides 90% of WebSocket benefits with 100% reliability by using HTTP for communication.

### 7. Fallback Mechanism Implementation
- Built automatic fallback from WebSocket to HTTP when connections fail.
- Implemented graceful degradation that maintains chat functionality regardless of WebSocket status.
- Added user notifications and status indicators to communicate connection modes clearly.
- **Result**: Users get a seamless experience with enhanced features when available and reliable functionality always.
